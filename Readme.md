# Fluence EthDenver Virtual '21 Hackathon  

Welcome to Ethdenver Virtual 2021 and the Fluence Hackathon where juicy bounties, extraordinary fame, oodles of fun and hordes of spork marmots await!  And yes, we are [hiring](https://fluence.network/join.html) !!

This repo is intended to be a central hub for all things Fluence ETHDenver hackathon.

## Fluence Overview
[Fluence](https://fluence.network/) is an open application platform powered by peer-to-peer computing protocol and a decentralized licensing system. Fluence enables developers to host applications in the decentralized network and collaborate on live applications, reusing components and data. The protocol creates an open marketplace of compute capacity, so availability and pricing are not controlled by a single company and instead are driven by competitive market forces.

Applications are faster to build, easier to integrate, and more secure due to the enhanced composability. Business logic is incorporated into data packets orchestrating the execution of distributed components. Just as code collaboration creates better products, composition via network protocol enables live apps to be forked, expanded, or re-arranged into new and enhanced user experiences.

Fluence uses blockchain to enable a new software business model. Application dependencies are globally available and secured on-chain, and authors can earn when their applications or components are used in the network. The hosting payments are coupled with the author rewards, so the more popular a component is in the network, the more revenue for hosts and authors.

## Hackathon Overview
The Fluence stack is very well suited to complement blockchains, and especially permissionless blockchains, with provisioning decentralized application and off-chain compute services. We want you to explore these themes with your hackathon projects. We offer teams to select one of two tracks, the Fluence Web3 Application track and Fluence Web3 Enabler Track for a total bounty of USD 6,000.

The Fluence Web3 Application track encourages teams to buidl Web3 dApps and dServices, such as oracles, relays, or processing algorithms. For example, within the context of a smart contract, a Fluence-based oracle application might be comprised of
* pull price (pair) data and other pertinent data from various DEXs and multiple blockchains
* implement the necessary data processing algorithms to arrive at the â€œoracle"
* compose these services into an application allowing data feed recipients to select inputs and data processing algorithms
* as a bonus, teams may want to enhance input, e.g., DEXs, and processing services, e.g., feed/stream smoothing algorithms, services with trust and reputation scores to further improve data feed subscribers' decision making. 

Another project direction might be to work off Ethereum's pending transactions to facilitate pertinant discovery of gas price trends or to feed plain old front running algorithms. The [Quickstart](web3-examples/Readme.md) provides some direction.

The Fluence Web3 Enabler Track, on the other hand, is geared toward seeding the Fluence Web3 ecosystem with the fundamental, reusable web3 tools, as services, to accelerate future web3 development with the Fluence stack. For example, implementing Ethereum type systems, codecs, RPL, etc. as composable and reusable services or even
port a Web3 SDK as a Fluence service development kit.

[See](Hackathon.md) for more details.

We are hosting an <i>interactive</i> [workshop](https://streamyard.com/dx7c9rhaf2) Saturday, 02/06/2021, 9:30am - 10:00am MST as party of the ETHDenver Workshop series and materials, as they become available, can be found in the [workshop](workshop) folder.

## Fluence Web3 Code Examples and Quickstart
The [web3-examples](web3-examples/Readme.md) repo contains a variety of backend code snippets and a quickstart covering backend services, deployment to the Fluence test network, and finally, composing the deployed services into a PoC [frontend](web-frontend) solution.
